My idea is that I can use recursion with memoization to handle this. I was thinking that I can start from bottom to top and then recursively compare the letters. For example, we could have ABAZDC and BACBAD, so it would check "A" vs "B" and then go "A" vs "A" and then keep looking ahead. On the topic of memoization I'm not sure, but I'm thinking it could potentially save the values for each of the already found indexes in the 2D array. I figured out that I should check the next letter if they do equal each other, but I think if they don't equal each other, then I should probably go to the next letter. |
| Feb 10 | 9:00 - 10:30 am  | We were thinking about how the tabulation works for the dynamic programming. We thought about using the 2d array for memization and realized that if theres 0 and 0 in the first row and first column then it works as a base case and sets all of them to 0. I encountered a bug when the for loops started at 0 but I added those extra row and column for the base case, but I realized from thinking that I had to add 1 instead of subtracting 1 in my nested for loop since im starting 1 deeper due to the extra row and column. For my recursion, I figured that I realized I needed some way to know if I'd already found a thing in the memoization 2d array, otherwise it wouldn't be efficient. I was stuck and forgot that in java 2d arrays set everything to 0, so i forgot I needed to set the starting index for every index in the array to something less than 0, I chose -1, so I can tell whether something was already found or just not calculated yet. |
