| Feb 7 | 12:30 - 15:00 pm | I was thinking about how I would approach this problem through the use of dynamic programming. My idea is that I can use recursion with memoization to handle this. I was thinking that I can start from bottom to top and then recursively compare the letters. For example, we could have ABAZDC and BACBAD, so it would check "A" vs "B" and then go "A" vs "A" and then keep looking ahead. On the topic of memoization I'm not sure, but I'm thinking it could potentially save the values for each of the already found indexes in the 2D array. I figured out that I should check the next letter if they do equal each other, but I think if they don't equal each other, then I should probably go to the next letter. |
